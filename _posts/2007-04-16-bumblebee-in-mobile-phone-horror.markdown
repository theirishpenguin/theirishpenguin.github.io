To date mobile phones have been blamed for brain tumours, low sperm counts and making kids even more annoying on bus trips, but here is the latest to add to the list - serial bee killer...

Bee colonies around the world have been mysteriously  disappearing over the last couple of years and apparently sticking a mobile phone phone in front of a hive is like sticking a AIDS patient in front of John Howard - they'll both run the other away screaming hysterically...

No bees means no pollenation... and [that's not good](http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/wildlife/article2449968.ece). I like apples.
