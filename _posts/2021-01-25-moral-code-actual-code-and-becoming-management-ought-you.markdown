I've just read a very interesting <a href="https://charity.wtf/2021/01/23/questionable-advice-how-do-i-feel-worthwhile-as-a-manager-when-my-people-are-doing-all-the-implementing/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy">Charity Majors</a>,
which tackles the question:


 > How do i feel worthwhile as a manager when my people are doing all the implementing?‚Äù

There are some great points in that post. I had a few thoughts stemming from
reading it and looked to hurriedly work through them in my own post here, and perhaps take things in a different direction. This started as a tweet but quickly spilled over the character limit. And I'd also like to
consolidate my thinking into a guiding principle for would-be managers or those wondering whether to continue with management or change course. Indeed, there does appear to be a simple
principle that can guide us - though not necessarily an easy answer:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **_Your job as a manager should be to act as a proponent and propagator of moral action for your team_**<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... and, in some way, for your organisation and wider society.

</div>

If you disagree, then you may be on shaky ground...

Charity Majors's post may or may not agree with this conclusion, and I
will not put words in anyone's mouth. However, it at least, in part, appears to allude to this when noting some of the responsibilities of a manager:

* To 'pick up on someone‚Äôs anxiety' and help
* To 'argue someone into receiving a well-deserved raise'
* To 'wielding your manager powers for good'

That last one hits it on the head (assuming one knows what **_good_**
is; admittedly, that is a big assumption). A crucial one to add to that list of responsibilities, the trait that, no doubt, many have seen as lacking in their leaders over the years, is:

<div style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>Don't throw people under a bus when the</i></b> üí© <b><i>hits the fan.</i></b>
</div>

That takes courage. And if you don't think you have that yet then you
should try to put that right before you accept or seek to be a manager.
In aggregate, enough managers lacking in this area makes for a horror show
software house. If you do think that you have that kind of virtue - and that doing the right thing doesn't drain you to the
point that you are an empty husk - then you at last have a foundation to potentially extract
satisfaction and worth from being a manager. If not, you should be wary.

##### Beyond Courage...
There is more to say on all this of course, such as the extra hours that it can
sometimes take because you are, at least in part, responsible for the
result of other people's work. And, I agree that missing out on the
problem solving and solution design nearer the code-level can be fatal
enough to one's happiness to decide against being a manager. In the
unlikely event that you have hours left over at the end of the day, there
may be that occasional moment that affords the chance to look into a
new technology (it's assumed that you won't have enough true code-level
context to efficiently dive into an existing problem that needs code
implementation in your organisation - hence, the suggestion to look into
a new technology instead).

My claim that there exists a *moral core* requirement may come into conflict (or may not; again, not wanting to put words in any mouths) with at least part of Charity
Majors's blog post:

>There seems to be precisely one acceptable answer to the question of
>what motivates managers: loftily waxing on and on about how they get
>ALL their joy and fulfillment from empowering others and watching other
>people succeed without ever personally building anything tangible or
>receiving ANY of the credit. I call bullshit. (This bugs the
>ever-loving crap out of me.)

<div style="text-align: right; padding-bottom: 30px;">
<i><b>Sidenote: </b>Charity's analogy to sleepless, vomit-coated parenthood is hilarious üòÄ</i>
</div>

My claim of a moral core requirement may appear too closely tied to
a manager fundamentally getting their kicks out of postively empowering others. I do believe, however, that if your core is not about
doing right by others then you will find the going difficult. If your moral code isn't set up for success then neither will the
actual code, nor your team, nor your chances of ongoing satisfaction. On the point of receiving credit, isn't it a rarity for an organisation to skip giving credit to managers?

##### What if you are a moral monster üëπ yet still want to be a manager?
Well, the good news is that much of morality can be learned. In many ways, you are what you
read. So, skipping a few of the blog posts on the latest tech trends and
finding some enjoyable and informative podcasts or books on ethics and philosophy more generally can help. These
can give you a solid foundation to extract happiness from managing and to be a more effective manager. Reducing lies, Lip-Servive Development (perhaps the topic of a future blog post, but you can guess at the meaning for now), and dogma are three great places to start.
