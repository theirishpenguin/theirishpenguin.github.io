And the results are in, YouTube 2 - 0 Hollywood! Mr Bay you have been beaten...

Easily, the best Transformer films of the summer are
	
  * [SuperNews! - Transformers 2](http://youtube.com/watch?v=gGQsthDNGW0&mode=related&search=) Michael Bay tries to talk Optimus and Co into doing a sequel

	
  * [Optimus Prime Gets Prostrate Cancer](http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZWYOQoui6Ks&mode=related&search=) Despite it's morbid title, this is hilarious!


Mee, Grimlock luv U-Tube!!!
