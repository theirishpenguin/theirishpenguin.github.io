This post is the expansion this [tweet](https://twitter.com/theirishpenguin/status/1038930632339058689).

**On the question of - is it pointless to debate if there will be no actionable outcome?**

Here's why I think engaging may be worth considering...

1. The Socratic method - Socrates coined the approach of debating simply to grow in knowledge, not necessarily to produce
an actionable outcome, and that has underpinned much of philosophy and science for millennia. This is abstract but to
make it concrete - what if an idea emerges during the debate that isn't hostile and turns out to be a net benefit
to humanity?

2. Regarding "if society agrees on the answer, then why debate?" - debating how absurd the other side's
argument will always be an important way to keep the lessons of history alive. I'll channel Angela Merkel with this
except from her [Davos
speech](https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Content/EN/Reden/2018/2018-01-24-bk-merkel-davos_en.html)...

3. If reasonable people don't debate the question then it will solely be
left to the radicals too debate and control the narrative.

4. This originating Twitter thread itself is, at some level, proof of the value of debating what was
presented as a taboo topic in the tweet initially quoted. I learned a lot from
the pressure put on my position. It's crystallised many fleeting
thoughts as written words and there's a clearer understanding of each
person's position, with many ambiguous points clarified.

**Regarding the [questions](https://twitter.com/lalonde/status/1038747232651169792) relating to the Fox News piece, asking "should we have an ethnically diverse population in a country?"**

This is a good example. Should we be afraid of this question being asked? No. I
haven't seen the rest of the Fox News piece other than the clip
shared but I suspect Japan could be used as an argument for the pro-low
diversity argument (NB: do not take the mentioning of that argument as an endorsement of that
point of view). Would the act of putting together a counter argument to
this make the pro-diversity argument stronger? Yes. Is there something
else in Japanese culture that we should consider reflecting on to see if we can isolate
a way to improve Western society? Maybe. Could some people be talked out of
taking a radical point of view by engaging on the topic? Probably.
