Good things come in small packages packages. But great things are scabable!

One such example is the Linux kernel - it can run on anything from a toaster to a supercomputer; how does it do it? The answer to this, and other interesting questions, can be found in the very readable guide to the Linux kernel by IBM [Anatomy of the Linux kernel](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-linux-kernel/?S_TACT=105AGX59&S_CMP=GR&ca=dgr-lnxw02LKernalAnatomy).
