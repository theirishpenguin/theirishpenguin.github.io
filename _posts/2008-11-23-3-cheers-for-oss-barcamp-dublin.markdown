Another exciting event has just been announced for Dublin next year with an Open Source Software Barcamp planned for Dublin March 28th next year. And you could be one of the speakers! The idea behind a barcamp is to have a casual relaxed atmosphere where the attendees can help drive the schedule - like a conference done in the spirit of Digg. For more info check out [Laura Czajkowski's blog post](http://www.lczajkowski.com/2008/11/20/ossbarcamp-28th-march-2009) and if you want to keep up to date with further details you can track things on [ossbarcamp on twitter](http://twitter.com/ossbarcamp).
