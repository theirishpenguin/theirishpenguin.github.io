The Irish Penguin branches out to a new platform this week as Mono, the Linux-y version .NET of is tackled. What wonders await...

Well, thus far, we're not actually sure, although early signs are promising. We pulled down the MonoDevelop codebase as well as it's dependancies via Subversion and most things built without major problems (on Ubuntu Fiesty) and a little help from the fabulous monodevelop-list AT lists.ximian.com (just replace AT with @) #. Although the holy grail of having a happily built MonoDevelop environment is proving just a little elusive - a conflict between Cario from v1.0 mono libraries and Cairo from v2.0 libraries is a spanner in the works. This should be a straightforward one to iron out.

It will be interesting to compare the Form's/Widget designer to the fabulous QT Designer and see if MonoDevelop provides a stable and first rate environment for doing GUIs. But of course, even more interesting will be the politics...
