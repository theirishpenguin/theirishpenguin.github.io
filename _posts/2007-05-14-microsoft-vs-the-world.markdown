Microsoft is allegedly preparing it's army of lawyers ([more than 800 strong](http://scobleizer.com/2007/05/13/microsoft-about-to-enter-into-patent-war/) according to one commentator) to issue an [almighty patent onslaught](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/) on Open Source software. It lists 235 patents which it says are being violated by Open Source software projects. Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer says that it is in the "name of honour" that he must fight the Open Source community. The battle lines are being drawn in what could prove to be the ultimate shakeup of the U.S. software patent system. As Microsoft comes under increased pressure from Open Source software it is making lawyers, not software developers, the front-line soldiers in the fight to maintain the apparent monopoly. It looks like we're entering interesting times.

On a lighter note, here's a [clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsboPUjrGc) of Steve Balmer trying to rally the Redmond programmers in better days before lawyers led software development. I wonder does he exhibit the same passion today when he stands in front of his devs or does he prefer to go into the TV lounge and flick on an episode of Boston Legal...
