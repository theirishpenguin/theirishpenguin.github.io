Just heard about this new awards ceremony [The Appys](http://www.theappys.ie/)! It will hand out the accolades to what it judges to be best mobile applications out there for a range of devices. As a long time Maemo fan and now MeeGo fan I'll be interested to see many apps are submitted for Nokia and its [Ovi](http://store.ovi.com) store.

Alas, my own humble efforts developing [Qt on Rails](http://www.theirishpenguin.com/2010/06/21/qt-on-rails-v0-1-released-but-is-this-ruby-based-qt-and-kde-app-framework-doomed/) apps aren't quite ready for entry. If you want to send in your own or vote on an app then today's deadline day! I just hope there's not too much in the way of gushing winners doing emotional acceptance speeches when the curtains come down on this one!
