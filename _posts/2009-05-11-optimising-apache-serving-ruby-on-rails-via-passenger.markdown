An unusual blog post this in that I have such little value to add other than pointing you at two great links. The first is a wonderfully useful post on tweaking Phusion Passenger when [running some Rails apps on a 256MB Slicehost VPS](http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/02/rails-performance-options-on-p.html) and the other link is a no-nonsense explanation of [tweaking Apache config options](http://forum.slicehost.com/comments.php?DiscussionID=3313) to cut down on your swap memory usage. Thanks so much to these folks!
