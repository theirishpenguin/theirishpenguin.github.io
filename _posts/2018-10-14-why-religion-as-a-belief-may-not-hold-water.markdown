The clock is ticking down in the run up to Ireland’s blasphemy
referendum on October 26th. Few commentators think that the law should
remain on the books. However, John Waters writes in The Sunday Times
that the blasphemy law should be kept to safeguard respect and belief
[[1](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/john-waters-launches-campaign-to-keep-blasphemy-in-constitution-5rg0nzbt7)].
His argument is confused on two grounds.

Firstly, just because something is held as a belief should not mean that
it is automatically worthy of respect. For example, you could hold the
belief that it is right to slaughter 5000 innocent women and children,
however it does not follow that this belief should be respected.
Secondly, and perhaps worth exploring in more detail here, is the
question of the meaning of *belief* itself. It could be argued that religions, typically, do not
truly offer a set of beliefs. Rather, they *assert to know*. This may seem
like a trivial difference, but it has important consequences. We can
flesh this out with a thought experiment.

I may be looking for my jacket at the end of an evening at a friend’s
house. I am standing in the hall and vaguely remember leaving the jacket
in the kitchen, which is directly off the hall. If it is in the kitchen,
but I do not have a clear line of sight to it, then I may *believe* that
the jacket is in the kitchen. However, if I do have a clear line of
sight to the jacket, then I will *know* that it is in the kitchen. The
effect of these two differing mindsets can be tested. If I merely
believe that my jacket is in the kitchen, and someone then tells me that
it in the sitting room, then I will most likely accept their suggestion
as a possibility. I will not dogmatically argue with them that, in fact,
the jacket is in the kitchen. I will not get angry at them. Nor will I
demand that it is offensive for them to suggest that the jacket may be
in a different room to the one I had in mind.

However, if I am asserting that I know that the jacket is in the kitchen
and someone tells me otherwise, there is a good chance that I would
robustly disagree with them. For I would
know that the jacket is in the room; I may even be pointing at the
jacket with conviction. Which of the two - *belief* or *assert to know* -
best describes the position of those who would argue for the
preservation of blasphemy legislation? Do they ever put forward their
*beliefs* and then qualify them by saying they might be wrong? Do these
sound like the kind of beliefs that may need defending by a
constitutional protection? Do these sounds like beliefs at all?

This difference, between belief and asserted knowledge, is not a new
concept being introduced here. Rather, it has been at the heart of
civilisation for over two thousand years - as epistemology - the
study of how certain we can be of things.
This is one of the core fields of philosophy, arguably first argued by
Xenophanes in the 5th century BCE. Since then, Plato, Aristotle and pretty
much every significant philosopher has had something to say
about it. [[2](https://historyofphilosophy.net/xenophanes)] This difference
is crucial and can guide us was to whether we want
to live in a country with blasphemy legislation, or without. The former
is the current situation in Ireland and other jurisdictions that have
legal measures in place to repress critical thinking. We have an
opportunity to put clear light between Ireland and countries that would
threaten, sanction and, in some cases, torture those who would defy
religious belief. [[3](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/views/ourview/blasphemy-referendum--it-is-important-that-we-all-vote-874981.html)]
So what is to be done on Friday, October 26th? We
are at a point in history where we can *assert to know* that repealing
this law is the right thing to do.
