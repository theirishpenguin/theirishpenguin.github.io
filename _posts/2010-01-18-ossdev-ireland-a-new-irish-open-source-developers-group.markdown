ossdev-ireland is a group set up to act as a melting pot for the various different Open Source groups in Ireland.

Many group mailing lists already exist in Ireland for individual technologies, development languages and frameworks. However, each community is sandboxed into its own world. As a result there is less chance for cross-pollination of ideas between FOSS technologies, communities and individuals. The ossdev-ireland mailing list is to augment the existing mailing lists as a place to share ideas across the entire Open Source development community in Ireland.

In particular, it would be great to see the outcomes of code jams, bug triage sessions, or even links to slides that were presented at a group meetup, posted here. You never know who may be interested!
