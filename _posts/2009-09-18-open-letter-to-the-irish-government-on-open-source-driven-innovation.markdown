"Recent years show that openness and collaboration is essential to the generation of innovation in the software sector. Technology increasingly means software. In Ireland, we can see that the production of hardware technology in many, but not all, cases is providing ever diminishing returns. Here we outline some key policy recommendations that are crucial to the fulfilling the vision of making the Irish Smart Economy a reality for the software industry through the adoption and encouragement of Open Source technologies."

The above extract is from a paper we are submitting to the [Innovation Taskforce](http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Innovation_Taskforce/Request_for_Submissions/) as requested by the Department of Taoiseach. The draft paper is available at [Positioning Ireland as an International Innovation Hub](http://www.weuseopensource.com/open-letter-to-irish-govt-on-open-source-driven-innovation.html)

Please note, we are submitting the paper ahead of the deadline which is Friday the 18th of September. We appreciate any feedback, support or criticisms you may have. Please post them as comments below.
