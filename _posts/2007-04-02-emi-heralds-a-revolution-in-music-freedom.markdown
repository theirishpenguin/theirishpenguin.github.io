At last the fight against anti-consumer record labels crippling music purchased online is looking to be at an end. EMI have decided to make their songs sold on iTunes free of DRM (Digital Rights Management) - a technology which prevented users playing back their music on any device of their choice. This is probably one of the most important changes that could have happened in the delivery of online music and is set to transform the industry and reduce piracy. As EMI boss Eric Nicoli said,

"We have to trust our consumers. We have always argued that the best way to combat illegal traffic is to make legal content available at decent value and convenient."

The new tracks will cost about 30 cent more per track. But the advantages of this greatly outweigh the cost increase and the tracks will also be of higher quality. In addition, customers who have already bought tracks will be given the option to pay the difference in price to make their entire existing collection DRM free.

The move is set to put pressure on other labels to stop restricting consumers' freedom to choose how to enjoy the music they've purchased. A victory for choice, economics and anti-piracy in the music industry. This post is based on a news item on the BBC at the following [link](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6516189.stm). So read more of the good news there. Here's to EMI taking a leading role in the music industry and setting the ball roling on the most important music issue today!
