Phew! After much fiddling and tweaking I finally managed to get my header image together for this site. All the while I had the song "The Irish Rover" bouncing round in my head - which probably didn't help matters!

But I think the above header was worth it.  Veronica, my glamorous girlfriend and graphic design mentor, didn't like it much to start with. At least I managed to pacify her by throwing in a cute penguin pic, which I did up in the absolutely fabulous Inkscape. Inkscape has to be one of the best Free Software programs ever. It's just so easy to use and yet things just always turn out good.  It's magic. And that's just the kind of thing you'll be hearing more about on this blog over the coming months along with other news and discussion from the filthy dirty world of Open Source.

Just a heads up for anyone trying to change their WordPress header image - make sure that you haven't changed the header's colours or anything previously in WordPress. If you have made changes then you should revert them - which can be done from the dashboard. Otherwise all the image uploading and CSS styling in the world won't be enough to get that flamin' header to change! Now there's an hour of my life that I won't get back! At least I had The Irish Rover playing away in the back of my head to keep me going...

Doo do doo...
