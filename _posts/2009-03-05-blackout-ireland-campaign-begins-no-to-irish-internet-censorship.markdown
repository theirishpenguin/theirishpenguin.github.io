The battle for control of the Internet has begun within Ireland. In the red corner, Eircom has sided with the Big Four record companies - Sony-BMG, Universal and Warner and EMI - who are seeking to control the Irish Internet using coporate censorship and civil law techniques. In the blue corner, the [Blackout Ireland](http://www.blackoutireland.com) campaign is looking to highlight the dangers of this censorship and has used social networking tools such as Twitter and Facebook to build support to protest this decision. A similar campaign was succesful in New Zealand, will it work again here?
