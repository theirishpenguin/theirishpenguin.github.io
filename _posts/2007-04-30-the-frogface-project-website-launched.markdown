We've tried to start this before and never quite finished it. You (edit: used to be able, this link is no longer available!) can check out the site at http://www.frogface.org This time things went smoothly, however I had to struggle through my hangover on Saturday while I polished off the final details. A big kudos to Veedles who did a smashing job creating the images and logo for the site - and now that she is the queen of web design is gonna spruce the site up even more over the coming weeks!

The Frogface project is an effort to create a user friendly scuba dive logging application which runs on any computer. It's still not ready for everyday use so us developers will have to keep beavering away for a while. Things are going well recently as I escaped my horribly busy work schedule in order to get phase 1 of the project done. Ganesh is working on getting the menu's together over the coming weeks and I'm gonna try and get my head around beautifying the user interface and making it look real pretty. As they say, "There's more than one way to skin an app!"
