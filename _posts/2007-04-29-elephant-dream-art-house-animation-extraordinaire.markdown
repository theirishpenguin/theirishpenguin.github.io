Here's a superb 12 minute animation which features crisp industrial post-modern backdrops puncuated by expressively crafted chararcters; all done in Blender - an open source 3D modelling on the verge of the big time. It's a hefty download so you'll want a broadband connection, but it's worth the wait. Just sit back and simply enjoy these wonderful graphics  by visiting the download section at [http://orange.blender.org](http://orange.blender.org)
