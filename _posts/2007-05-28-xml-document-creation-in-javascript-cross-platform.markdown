This is an absolutely super guide which basically gives you some neat code in order to work with XML documents across multiple platforms in the sadistic language of the web - Javascript.

It's a 4 page tutorial which overviews a static JS class that the author has put together which provides helper methods for creating a new XML document on the client browser by loading from disk, URL's or strings.  I found it especially useful for squeezing a javascript string into a nice XML representation. Check it out on [WebReference.com](http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/definitive2/4.html)
