      <h3>On Gender, Sex and a Spectrum of Influences</h3>
      <article class="post-content">
        <p><p>The issue of transgender rights has come to the fore quite prominently
in recent times, in part no doubt due to the clampdown on such rights by
the Trump administration. Bans on serving in the military and a plethora
of bathroom bills across the US have ensured a fiery reaction. It is
unsurprising then that the number of articles and editorials on the
<em>nature of trans</em> has increased in scientific publications, such as Nature
and Scientific American. These articles have posited scientific evidence
and facts that are likely to be well received by the transgender
community. However, in a recent Quillette article, Colin Wright counters
with an accusation that this movement could be dubbed ‘The New Evolution
Deniers’. His analysis is explored here, where the question as to
whether these articles claimed that biological sex should be considered
a spectrum is scrutinised. This question is important because clarity is
needed as to whether a trend exists, in these scientific publications,
in moving away from a binary definition of biological sex.</p>

</p>

<p>It is worth noting at the outset that the treatment of the discussion
here neither seeks to take a position on how biological sex should be
defined, nor is it intended to be in any way hostile to Wright nor the
articles he references. It is instead an attempt to look for objective
facts that can form the basis of further discussions. It does seek to
(unemotionally) unpick conflations to provide clarity on the fundamental
issues. Finally, it is written in good faith with the intention of
furthering the discussion rather than fuelling flames. Hopefully, that
comes across or else it is a failure in the writing of this article
itself.</p>

<p>Wright’s central concern is in what he sees as ‘social justice activists
attempt to jump the epistemological shark by claiming that the very
notion of biological sex […] is a social construct.’ He stakes out his
own position as acknowledging ‘the existence of very rare cases in
humans where sex is ambiguous’ but states that ‘this does not negate the
reality that sex in humans is functionally binary.’
[<a href="https://quillette.com/2018/11/30/the-new-evolution-deniers/">1</a>]</p>

<p>Wright takes issue with the journal Nature, which in his view,
“published an editorial claiming that classifying people’s sex ‘on the
basis of anatomy or genetics should be abandoned’”. [<a href="https://quillette.com/2018/11/30/the-new-evolution-deniers/">2</a>] However, if one
takes the fuller literal quote from the Nature article (which so happens
to be its title and subtitle), the context sheds new light:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>US proposal for defining gender has no basis in science.<br />
A move to classify people on the basis of anatomy or genetics should
be abandoned. [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-07238-8">3</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see that the subject is actually <em>gender</em> not <em>sex</em>, something that is
non-obvious from how the quote was referenced in the Quillette article.</p>

<p>In a second extract from Nature, Wright finds the phrase ‘the research
and medical community now sees sex as more complex than male and female’
as contrary to his position. [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-07238-8">4</a>] However, this quote does not indicate
that Nature is calling for a non-binary definition of biological sex.
The only thing clearly posited is that there is an underlying complexity
that the scientific community, as well as the population at large, was
unaware of.</p>

<p>In a third quotation of the Nature article, Wright examines the
article’s motives, claiming that they are to counter the opinion that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>acknowledging the reality of biological sex will ‘undermine efforts
to reduce discrimination against transgender people
and those who do not fall into the binary categories of male or
female.’ [<a href="https://quillette.com/2018/11/30/the-new-evolution-deniers/">5</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the phrase ‘who do not fall into the binary categories of male
or female’ never claims to relate to biological sex in the Nature
article. [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-07238-8">6</a>] It can be granted that the paragraph preceding it (in
Nature) did refer to ‘the sex on a birth certificate’ as part of
discussing the Department of Health and Human Services memo. [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-07238-8">7</a>]
However, that is a separate paragraph and it is far more likely that the
‘male or female’ in the discrimination quote is referring to gender when
talking about ‘binary categories’. [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-07238-8">8</a>]</p>

<p>It would appear that the Nature article has been carefully written to
keep terminology such as sex and gender as distinct and appropriately
utilised in all cases. And that the Quilette article is confused in its
interpretation of it.</p>

<p>Moving onto the first of the Scientific American articles, Wright’s
response is less susceptible to correction as the title and subtitle
illustrate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Sex Redefined: The Idea of 2 Sexes Is Overly Simplistic<br />
 Biologists now think there is a larger spectrum than just binary
female and male [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sex-redefined-the-idea-of-2-sexes-is-overly-simplistic1/">9</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the main body of the article does not bear that out. The parts
of it that come closest to doing so never cross the gender/sex line. For
example, Ainsworth notes that ‘studies of DSDs have shown that sex is no
simple dichotomy.’ [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sex-redefined-the-idea-of-2-sexes-is-overly-simplistic1/">10</a>] Initially, that may sound like a reaction to the
idea of binary biological sex. However, a more nuanced reading shows
that it:</p>

<p>a. Conveys the general spirit of the difficulty, in some cases, of
assigning a biological sex (which is relatively uncontroversial) and</p>

<p>b. In no way rules out the possibility of biological sex as a dichotomy.
It very much allows, and is compatible with, a hypothetical statement
such as ‘Studies of DSDs have shown that sex is a complex dichotomy.’</p>

<p>The article comes closer to the topic of social constructs where
Ainsworth writes, ‘when it comes to sex, there is still intense social
pressure to conform to the binary model.’ [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sex-redefined-the-idea-of-2-sexes-is-overly-simplistic1/">11</a>] Again, at first glance
this can seem like an attack on the binary biological sex model.
However, the sentence that follows it, “This pressure has meant that
people born with clear DSDs often undergo surgery to ‘normalize’ their
genitals […] usually performed on babies, who are too young to
consent, and risks assigning a sex at odds with the child’s ultimate
gender identity”. [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sex-redefined-the-idea-of-2-sexes-is-overly-simplistic1/">12</a>] Again, it is clear that there is no call to
redefine biological sex as a spectrum here, simply that ‘doctors and
parents should at least wait until a child is old enough to communicate
their gender identity’. [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sex-redefined-the-idea-of-2-sexes-is-overly-simplistic1/">13</a>]</p>

<p>Even the article’s closing quote by (an oft-referenced source in the
article) Eric Vilain, ‘at the end of the day, gender identity seems to
be the most reasonable parameter’, revolves around gender, not
biological sex. [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sex-redefined-the-idea-of-2-sexes-is-overly-simplistic1/">14</a>]</p>

<p>The only line where the article directly considers biological sex as a
spectrum is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet if biologists continue to show that sex is a spectrum, then
society and state<br />
will have to grapple with the consequences, and work out where and
how to draw the line. [<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sex-redefined-the-idea-of-2-sexes-is-overly-simplistic1/">15</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even in this case, Ainsworth appears to be alluding to the fact that the
evidence presented is insufficient to make a strong claim of biological
sex being a spectrum. Perhaps, the biggest source of confusion is
between the article title/subtitle and its content. If one was to
conclude that this epistemologically detracts from the article then it
is unfortunate for the contents of the article itself, which outline an
array of interesting science. Though Wright would seem to have some
justification to cite this article as being in opposition to his point
of view.</p>

<p>In the final article Wright references, again from Scientific American,
entitled ‘Visualizing Sex as a Spectrum’ the author, Amanda Montañez,
is unambiguous:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DSDs […] represent a robust, evidence-based argument to reject
rigid assignations of sex and gender. [<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/visualizing-sex-as-a-spectrum/">16</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, it is clear that the article is worthy of being positioned
as contrary to Wright’s definition of biological sex.</p>

<p>In summary, it would seem, ironically, that we have arrived at a
spectrum of sorts; as we move from the Nature article to the latter of
the Scientific American articles, we go from a place where no non-binary
definitions of biological sex are being proposed towards one where there
is.</p>

<p>Whilst this commentary takes no position on the definition of biological
sex, there appears to be one point of agreement that can be universally
stated. Whatever about a consensus view on the ‘spectrum of outcomes’,
of observable and testable data points to objectively define biological
sex 100% of the time, it is certain that the ‘spectrum of influences’,
the genetic development and hormonal interactions, is much more complex
than ever imagined. Perhaps this can form the basis of a productive
discussion going forward - one that caters to the reality of each
individual’s circumstances, while at the same time catering to the
objective necessity of science. To channel Aristotle, we need <em>to honour
truth above our genitals.</em></p>
