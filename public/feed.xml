        <title>There Is No Place Quite Like Hell</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I recently came across a headline somewhere outlining that pope Francis said that hell did not exist. Given a recent uptick in my interest in philosophy, it struck me as an interesting article to dive into. Of course, anytime you really want to find an article you recently swiped past, the forces of the universe will conspire against you to make sure that you never succeed in finding it. So I resorted to the only thing that can consistently mitigate the forces of the universe - Google. A quick Internet search later and we were back in business. And I had got something altogether different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;margin:0px;&quot;&gt;

        licence.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/03/29/vatican-denies-report-that-says-pope-francis-believes-hell-does-not-exist/&quot;&gt;the pope did not say that hell did not exist&lt;/a&gt; but instead was misquoted. Rather the doctrine states that “the chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God”. Well, let’s go Aristotle on this and see if this latter interpretation is logically possible…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;God is omnipresent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sidenote (and axiom) - God created hell&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hell is defined primarily as a separation from God (as noted in the linked article above)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But God must be present in hell otherwise he is not omnipresent (ie. there would be places he cannot be - a contradiction)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore it is not possible for one to be separated from God - as God is omnipresent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conclusion - hell cannot exist as per that definition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we may not quite have put the fallible in papal infallibility yet but we have arrived at an interesting place. Now there are some lines of attack on the above conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;omnipresent-slipperiness&quot;&gt;Omnipresent Slipperiness&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first place to cast doubt on the above logic is to bend the meaning of omnipresent. As we humans are well versed in experiencing and thinking about “being present” as a occupying a place in space and time, this can lead to defining presence as a physical location. And one could argue that hell could exist beyond what we know as space and time. To satisfy the separation from God claim, however, God still cannot exist in this hell. That would imply that there is an area beyond space and time that God does not exist in - and it would seem unlikely that this is a satisfactory conclusion for any interlocutor. So omnipresent means omnipresent in space and time as well as beyond space and time - no exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;separation-slipperiness&quot;&gt;Separation Slipperiness&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If omnipresent is taken to mean omnipresent in the broadest sense of the word, as noted in the previous point, then a next reasonable line of attack is to pressure the definition of separation. This, it could be argued, means a feeling of isolation from God rather than the (meta)physical separation from God that would immediately spring to mind. This would require God to somehow impart thoughts of isolation in the mind of the condemned. For the purposes of this argument we need to grant that something akin to feeling, thoughts and mind are possible in the metaphysical world. Once granted, we would also accept that God has omnipotence as per the doctrine and is all powerful. Indeed, this omnipotence could then be used to impart the thought of isolation. However, this would appear to be a rather bizarre employment of illusions - inducing a feeling of isolation in a subject that you created, for the purposes of punishing them for actions they took based on how you created them. At this point it would begin to simply look like a sadistic abusive relationship, which would hardly be compatible with the spirit of the doctrine (if you excuse the pun).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;dimensional-quagmire&quot;&gt;Dimensional Quagmire&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can argue and expend much energy on things like - if the logic proposed entertains a hell, which resides outside of space and time then how can it be created by God in the first place - as there would be no time dimension to allow hell to come into existence. However, the logic leading to the conclusion that “hell cannot exist as a separation from God” at the core of this article adds and subtracts nothing from the existing doctrine. So feel free to think for as long as you want about these issues but it would appear to be out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it - there is no place quite like hell!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson and Douglas Murray at Dublin's 3Arena. And Why...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An event that caused plenty of controversy in some quarters went down in front of quite a full house of eight and half thousand in the 3Arena on Saturday 14th of July. Here, a few of the Intellectual Dark Web’s (&lt;a href=&quot;http://intellectualdark.website/&quot;&gt;IDW&lt;/a&gt;) leading actors interlocked for the first time in Dublin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson&quot;&gt;Jordan Peterson&lt;/a&gt; is a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. He became infamous in 2016 for announcing his objection to the Canadian government’s Bill C-16 and said he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty. This, along with his disdain for what he describes as the radical left, make him a divisive figure to say the least. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris&quot;&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/a&gt; is an American philosopher, neuroscientist, and author of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://samharris.org/podcast/&quot;&gt;Waking Up podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He is a strong critic of religion and posits that science can provide the answers to improving human well-being and society. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Murray_(author)&quot;&gt;Douglas Murray&lt;/a&gt; is a British author, journalist and political commentator. He is a particularly strong critic of recent European migration policy and advocated the case for Britain to vote “leave” during the Brexit referendum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lightbulb&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/lightbulb-1875247_640.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening largely figured Jordan Peterson painting colourful if somewhat meandering arguments in favour of religion as the necessary basis for the moral development of society. Meandering is both a regular criticism and virtue of Peterson. If he was a body of water he would be an oxbow lake. Peterson’s position in favour of religion was in contrast to Harris’ fact-based rational view of how to progress humanity towards his definition of society’s twin ethical goals - the minimisation of suffering and the maximization of human well-being. These were goals that all the panel could agreed on. A fuller account of what they discussed is covered in the accompanying article &lt;a href=&quot;peterson-vs-harris-and-the-facts-of-moral-life&quot;&gt;Peterson Vs Harris, and the Facts of (Moral) Life&lt;/a&gt;, which contains the philosophical detail of Harris’ and Peterson’s points of difference. It has been kept separate for the benefit of readers who’d rather not dig into the philosophical depths of the debaters’ minds. But you are encouraged to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nice-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;If Peterson was a body of water he would be an oxbow lake.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening contained a large mix of topics. In addition to the morality debate, time was devoted to steelmanning an argument, immigration, Brexit, blasphemy legislation and why some of the panelists get accused of being nazis. Your opinion of the event will largely depend on what you want to take from it. You can take the pure philosophy, with many examples detailed in the accompanying article linked above. You can take it to be an event of interest to people on the right of the political spectrum. You can even take it as an event for political extremists. However, it certainly has as much content for someone on the left of the landscape, or in the centre. It is, in part, the misassumption of the motives of an attendee of the event that lead to the authoring of this article. More than anything, conversations like this one at the 3Arena showcase the ability of people with strongly divergent views to civilly debate in good faith. It is a training ground for developing the art of critical thinking. It is highly likely that you won’t entirely agree with one of the panel on everything - so you can be more of a fan of a panelist’s position in an argument than being a fan of the panelist making the argument. That said, it is undoubted that the panelists each have a fan following. That’s human nature. But often coverage of these events has focused on this point - on a narrative of cult-like adoration being the story. This is to miss the point - the debating of different viewpoints and taboo topics against the backdrop of a world where politics and people are becoming increasing polarised. A world that sleepwalked in Brexit, Trump and populism. Societies where virtually the entire population, mostly likely including you, consumes their news through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles&quot;&gt;filter bubble&lt;/a&gt; - forever swiping on a smartphone in an enclosed sphere where you only hear the voices of people you like and are like you. Welcome to identity politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nice-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Your opinion of the event will largely depend on what you want to take from it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest problems in Irish politics has historically been identity politics - with both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael maintaining a true cult-like hold over their support on the basis of identity rather than ideas. The same is true for Healy-Rae voters and other “esoteric” political actors around the country. And so these actors get demonised by the other side - they go back to their tribe to say how “everyone is against us”, double down on their core base, and get re-elected. And so the wheel turns. You can argue that identity politics was a positive force in the recent 8th amendment referendum. However you can also argue that, without Micháel Martin stepping outside of the traditional Fianna Fáil identity, the dynamics of the referendum conversation would have been different - if not the winning margin itself. It’s conjecture but it’s not an unreasonable statement. It may be the left that has the most to lose from identity politics. In the immediate aftermath of the same referendum, the ink had barely dried on the tweets of relief at the result when this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Glinner/status/1002562084784230402&quot;&gt;twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; erupted regarding gender identity. A messy fight on how the referendum was won, dividing would-be allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity is important. Group identity is important. But play too much politics with it and the sound of backfire is all but assured. Many of the IDW conversations look to push back on this. Instead of seeking to amplify the differences of opinion, they revolve around looking to find common ground between two differing points of view, around reaching across the aisle, around civil disagreement. It is hard to see how this is not important as we stand on the cusp of an increasingly tribal world ready to detonate. It has been mentioned that a significant part of the audience for this kind of event is made up of depressed marginalised men. Though one cannot rule out that depressed marginalised men were at the event, there was certainly a level of gender balance (and emotional balance) on show. Take what you want from this event, but it would be impolite to assume that this is what everyone else is taking too. It is in ears of the beholder. Maybe this is something we will have to civilly disagree on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Peterson Vs Harris, and the Facts of (Moral) Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This breakout article accompanies the summary of the Intellectual Dark Web event in Dublin on Saturday July 14th - &lt;a href=&quot;on-sam-harris-jordan-peterson-and-douglas-murray-at-dublins-3arena&quot;&gt;On Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson and Douglas Murray at Dublin’s 3Arena&lt;/a&gt;. As that article frames much of the conversation below you are encouraged to start there first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;margin:0px;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/ethics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ethics Picture&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;font-style: italic; margin-top: 5px;&quot;&gt;

        licence.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this breakout is a little uncomfortable. The conversation on the evening isn’t really best described as Peterson vs Harris. Rather it was a case of both debaters, along with Douglas Murray, trying to work towards more a common viewpoint. Though they never quite got there on the core issue. To give this core issue a descriptive title, let’s coin a phrase “fact-only morality”. What is this and why does this matter? Well, if there can be agreement that a moral way to live can be based on facts and truth claims alone, then it undermines the idea that humanity needs a little bit of extra supernatural embellishment to coerce ourselves into doing what’s best for both us and our neighbour. First up we need to establish one piece of jargon - “human values”. &lt;em&gt;These are defined as the principles that are the foundation for how to live a moral life. What consitutes a human value may not always be clear. For example, what is best for one group of people may be negative for another. So as we navigate the solution space of what is “net best” for the complete set of groups (which may overlap), there will be tradeoffs to make. Now that this definition is out of the way&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, let’s dive right in…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peterson provided interesting anecdotes ranging from how, in moving from a simplistic creature such as a sea sponge to a higher level animal such as a human, there is simply too much information processing by the brain occurring to be explained by a simple mapping of facts to human values. He argued that within this space there must be some unit other than facts at play - a unit that is a function of human perception and human interpretation of the sensory data arriving at the brain. The intractable problem of not being able to anchor these non-fact based units of human thinking to human values meant that religion was necessary - to provide that anchoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harris disagreed and countered with a view of the human brain’s information processing as “facts all the way down” - that what Peterson had claimed as non-facts due to their complexity and unknowability was still simply facts. He argued unknowablity does not preclude us from making truth claims about an unknowable answer. For example, we don’t know whether we have an odd or even number of hairs on our body, yet we should be confident in asserting that the number of hairs on our body is odd or even. On the other hand, he illustrated that even when artificial systems - such as neural networks in computer science - can provide answers to questions, we do not fundamentally know how they have arrived at their conclusions. Being a black box, the neural network provides a similar space in which we could consider non-facts as existing; yet we don’t need a religious wedge to fill the void there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nice-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Anytime it entered the crosshairs of the conversation, Harris used an Occam-like razor to quickly carve religion off the carcass of the moral debate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the other points Peterson made followed a similar arc - often punctuated with elegant language and showman-like gestures. He has a talent for explaining complex biological subjects in a simple manner. One of the interesting features of the night was that he avoided the meat of religious discourse and doctrine. Instead he went as far as to say that he was going to consciously focus on explaining his religious argument in purely biological and scientific terms. He kept to his word. Nonetheless, whether through biological reasoning or otherwise, anytime it entered the crosshairs of the conversation, Harris used an Occam-like razor to quickly carve religion off the carcass of the moral debate. Peterson voiced a concern with the purely secular approach to society building as lacking in storytelling and not being sufficiently inspiring to unify large groups of people to co-exist together. Unsurprisingly Harris disagreed. All the time Murray bridged the space between them, leaning more towards Peterson’s side on these latter concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the main topic of the evening. So with this sidebar over, you can return to where you were in the &lt;a href=&quot;on-sam-harris-jordan-peterson-and-douglas-murray-at-dublins-3arena&quot;&gt;On Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson and Douglas Murray at Dublin’s 3Arena&lt;/a&gt; article. Or enjoy a well-deserved coffee break or something stronger after powering though all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Being relatively new to the subject matter in this paragraph, I have outlined &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; understanding of the term “human values”, which I don’t recall being explicitly defined on the evening. Please comment if this understanding is erroneous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Morning Moments from UXDX Conf 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The RDS was looking stunning for the arrival of UXDX Conf on the Dublin
scene. By genius or by co-incidence the organisers had picked a day on
which the schools were off, making for a pleasant low-traffic commute.
As you would expect, the registration process was smooth ( and exhibited
good UX :) and the coffee kicked the cobwebs off any latent sleepiness
hanging around. Here are some moments from the first half of the day,
far from a comprehensive roundup. Any talks excluded were simply victims
of resourcing constraints, whilst trying to write this up on the
day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Main Conf&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/uxdx-conf-2016/main-conf.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas Powell, Design Principal at IBM got the day off to a positive
start…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nice-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;This is an amazing time to be a designer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas expanded on why by outlining the increasing count of designers
that are now involved as VCs, the number of design students in China,
and the design course that’s been plotted by industry ever since 2007
and the arrival of the iPhone. A significant subset of people arriving
to UXDX are probably feeling their way in design, perhaps coming from
different backgrounds, and Douglas had plenty of advice for them. In
particular, he pointed anyone not familiar with the work of John Maeda
towards the #designintech report, a crucial resource to help keep
abreast of some of the latest design thinking. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kpcb.com/blog/design-in-tech-report-2016&quot;&gt;2016
edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Douglas Powell&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/uxdx-conf-2016/douglas.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas talked about the importance of diversity in the product team in
order to build teams capable of arriving at great designs. He filled us
in on some headline figures, including IBM’s ratio of designers to
developers, which has evolved over the years from 1:33 to 1:8. And he
closed his session by stressing the importance of empathy within your
team as well as within the design process itself…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nice-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Empathy, first with each other then with our user.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one of the mornings talks was by Rasmus Skjoldan, Lead Product
Manager of Magnolia CMS. He challenged certain mantras such as “Rapid
Prototyping is always awesome”, warning of the danger of taking this too
far. While good for early feedback, it can lead to teams prematurely narrowing down the breath of
potential solutions in a rush to get a product to market. He noted the
fashion industry’s approach to mitigating this by baking multiple trends
and ideas into a single concept car or piece of haute couture - ie. a
deliberately unsellable product. From here, distinct lines of sellable
products can be then developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Rasmus Change Aversion&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/uxdx-conf-2016/change-aversion.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Frontend’s Founder - Fiona Murphy - continued the call to arms…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nice-quote&quot;&gt;“Design like you give a damn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and she posed the question of whether UX could change the world. This
was a talk littered with feel good moments. She outlined the positive
effects of the Estonian government’s declaration of access to Internet
being a fundamental human right and how UX can improve the experience of
migrants by simplifying processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fiona Design Damn&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/uxdx-conf-2016/design-damn.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian Trenaman, SVP Engineering at HBC Digital/GILT gave a very
entertaining talk on organising multi-discipline teams and how this
evolved over time at GILT. Early on, they realised that to create
autonomous teams they needed to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nice-quote&quot;&gt;“Give engineers a problem, not a solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and look to make engineers “agents of change”. These autonomous teams
followed a KPI driven development process to ensure they were on the
right track. But they found that, initially, autonomous teams would be
struck with stage fright soon after having taken control of the steering
wheel. And they invested considerable effort in correcting this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these solutions, Adrian frequently offered contrarian viewpoints. He
took a Peter Drucker quote “Culture eats strategy for breakfast” and
added his own twist…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 750px&quot; alt=&quot;Breakfast&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/uxdx-conf-2016/brekkie.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… as well as noting that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nice-quote&quot;&gt; “Great culture is necessary but not sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian continued to put the controversial cat amongst the pigeons,
promoting a “code first” then ask questions later approach to evolving a
solution, as well as not being afraid to back away from the data driven
approach in favour of empathy. He also praised the technique of using a
Gantt-like chart for planning out 90 day windows. And rather than dividing up the design team and permanently
embedding them within development teams, they kept this “spiritual
brotherhood“ together. Breaking them apart would not have been good for
a team which loved working together as a unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the motivation of all the teams within the organisation, Adrian
cited 3 crucial factors: autonomy, mastery and purpose. These three
factors would be echoed by David O’Donoghue, Head of Engineering at
Zalando, later on in the day so this trio likely deserve careful
attention. They were originally put forward in a talk by Daniel Pink
available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; when
researchers observed how teams tackled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_problem&quot;&gt;Candle Problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Adrian signed off with a tremendous set of values…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 550px&quot; alt=&quot;Values&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/uxdx-conf-2016/values.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian’s slides are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/trenaman/uxdx-2016-developer-thinking-building-a-developer-mindset-throughout-your-organisation&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; and well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, Travis George, a Gaming Industry Product Specialist talked
about Designs that Resonate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Travis&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/uxdx-conf-2016/travis.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He expanded on this by saying products with resonance are those that
make you feel like the product was made just for you. He warned that
great products are not just about smooth user flows, they are about
making a connection. His talk focused on ensuring that your
product/development team really feels the same way as the end users
about the game or product being built…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nice-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Sympathy is not the same as empathy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many more talks to follow and unfortunately we didn’t have
the bandwidth to try and capture them all. Many thanks to the organisers -
especially Catherine and Rory - for organising the event, and it will
be interesting to see where UXDX goes from here. No pressure! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; max-width: 50%;&quot; alt=&quot;UXDX Other Logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/uxdx-conf-2016/wood-uxdx.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you enjoyed the coverage of a few early moments from a
wonderful day at UXDX Conf 2016, especially if you didn’t have the
privilege of attending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite restricting the above to just the pre-lunch
sessions as a matter of practicality, it would be remiss to omit the
closing keynote entirely - a talk given by Kai En Ong, Head of UX &amp;amp;
Design of the BBC. She covered a wide diversity of topics, too many to
detail here, but she made two interesting points on improving the gender
balance in teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firstly, simply count - measuring and talking about the diversity in
your teams and on your boards helps bring a focus to the issue.
Secondly, and less obviously, is check your job description for gender
specific keywords - you can unintentionally bias your hiring process by
using language that is coded for one particular gender.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fixing a VirtualBox 4 to 5 Upgrade by Reinstalling Guest Host Additions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This upgrade did not go quite as smoothly as expected but after a bit of shouting at
the computer we got there. The issues may have been specific to the
state of my virtual machine image and possibly won’t affect other people
upgrading. Anyway in my case, after I upgraded to VirtualBox 5 and began
to use my image with it, I realized Copy &amp;amp; Paste between the host and the
guest would not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;responsive-post-figure&quot;&gt;

&lt;a title=&quot;By Matthieu James
(https://code.google.com/p/faenza-icon-theme/) [GPL
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)], via Wikimedia Commons&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AVirtualbox_Faenza.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;responsive-post-figure__image&quot; width=&quot;291&quot; alt=&quot;Virtualbox Faenza&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Virtualbox_Faenza.svg/480px-Virtualbox_Faenza.svg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally Shared folders between the host and guest would not work.
This left me with no option to communicate a piece of text between the
host and guest, so rather than limping on like a dying goldfish I was
forced to confront the problem head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Turns out I needed to uninstall and reinstall the Guest Host Additions (GHA).&lt;/b&gt; As
mentioned before this may be a problem specific to my image. It might
have only become a problem when I did a software update on the guest OS
(Ubuntu 14.04). The takeaway point is if Copy and Paste stops
working, check to see if your Guest Host Additions are borked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to reinstall the GHA according to the non-open source VirtualBox
instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the solution to performing a correct GHA reinstall at this
&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=46626#p210465&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.
Here is a summary below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;uninstall-gha-as-follows&quot;&gt;Uninstall GHA as follows&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NB:&lt;/b&gt; Don’t unmount the existing GHA iso from the Optical
Storage media (if you do you can re-add it at the correct location on the
host - eg. /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind here is how you can perform an uninstall. Run the
following within the &lt;b&gt;guest&lt;/b&gt; OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-X.Y.Z (where X.Y.Z is the old version of VirtualBox)
sudo ./uninstall.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;reinstall-gha-as-follows&quot;&gt;Reinstall GHA as follows&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure you don’t have any Ubuntu based guest host additions
installed. The command “aptitude search VirtualBox|grep add” should
return no installed packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you are ready to do the reinstall. Run the following within the
&lt;b&gt;guest&lt;/b&gt; OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /media/yourusername
cd VBOXADDITIONS_X.Y.Z_BUILD
# ... where X.Y.Z is the NEW version of VirtualBox and BUILD is presumably a build number
sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your GHA should be correctly reinstalled and things like Copy &amp;amp;
Paste as well as Shared folders should work again!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Embarrassing First Steps with the Javascript fetch() API</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spoiler: If you are more interested in the destination than the journey
then skip to the last code example in this article.&lt;/b&gt;
So after a decade of the dollar, the great $ symbol that is ubiquitously
associated with jQuery (and mostly AJAX), we’re finally moving on. Moving
on to what promises to be a leaner, more modern
API in the shape of fetch(). My motivation came from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/723#issuecomment-139927639&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;
about waiting for multiple async calls in Redux. I’d been using jQuery (or a layer on top
of jQuery such as Backbone) to talk to remote servers since
James Blunt hit the charts with “You’re Beautiful”. And since moving
to React it didn’t seem to make much sense to pull in all of jQuery just
to make a few simple remote calls - so trusting in Dan Abramov (has he
ever put a foot wrong?!) I decided to polyfill in fetch() and friends,
and embrace the simplicity of this new standard. Trouble is, it’s not as
straightforward to get started as you might think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin:20px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;a title=&quot;By JavaScript,Pixabay (pixabay.com) [CC BY 4.0
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)], via Wikimedia Commons&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AJavascript-736400_960_720.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;256&quot; alt=&quot;Javascript-736400 960 720&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Javascript-736400_960_720.png/256px-Javascript-736400_960_720.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, my understanding of promises is fairly
rudimentary - basically they are a fancy way of returning a function
that will be called at some point in the future, and can handle a happy
code path and a sad code path. I’d read that jQuery’s way of doing promises
(deferreds) “are a bit… unhelpful”. And that you should &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/&quot;&gt;cast them to
standard promises, which is worth doing as soon as possible&lt;/a&gt;,
. So I had an immediate
distrust of jQuery’s deferreds from what I had read and was ready to go
all in on the shiny new fetch() API to ensure that I was using the most
standard version of promises that bitcoins can buy. By this point
we’re really up for doing the fetch() thing correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hit on Google for “fetch javascipt” is the
Mozilla Development Network’s article on the Fetch API and from here it
is a short hop to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch&quot;&gt;Using Fetch
article&lt;/a&gt;.
So I rushed to the first example, which is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;var myImage = document.querySelector('img');

fetch('flowers.jpg')
.then(function(response) {
  return response.blob();
})
.then(function(myBlob) {
  var objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(myBlob);
  myImage.src = objectURL;
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and wrote the equivalent code (slightly ES6-ified) that I needed which was…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch('my-json-serving-url')
.then(response =&amp;gt; {
  debugger
  //return response.blob();
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got rid of the second then() because I figured my use case is simpler than
theirs. And I figured that if I could drop myself into the Chrome
debugger I could work out the appropriate method on the response
object to get whatever I needed out. It was all looking familiar and
simple, just like it said on the tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got to my breakpoint and I saw a friendly &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;text()&lt;/code&gt; method available
as well as a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json()&lt;/code&gt; method. And indeed I called them - and
frustratingly got the following back in my JS console…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[PromiseStatus]] : &quot;resolved&quot;
[[PromiseValue]] : undefined
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I googled around for “pending status fetch promise” and the first hit
was &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30329485/why-is-the-promise-still-pending&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; -
trusting in StackOverflow (have they ever put a foot wrong?!) I
clicked through to question but saw the answer didn’t look quite as relevant to me
as I’d hoped. So I moved along - along to lots of articles like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/625&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which sounded
very complicated for the “Hello World!” of the fetch() world that I was
trying to piece together, so I gave up. I knew that there was
new-fangled streaming stuff in the new fetch() and I must be tripping up
on that - might be best to read about that on my aging Nexus phone on
the commute home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was closing down the hundreds of tabs I had opened about fetch() - one by one - like a
roadie taking down marquees at the end of a music festival, I paused
before X-ing
the tab where it had all
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/723#issuecomment-139927639&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt;.
It occurred to me that instead of going for the cheapest item in the
shop, I should probably try the second cheapest. I’ll
try two then() calls one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch('my-json-serving-url')
.then(response =&amp;gt; {
  return response.json();
})
.then(responseBody =&amp;gt; {
  debugger
  // oh responseBody, just please have something in you that isn't pending!
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom! Like a green light at the end of a unit test there was finally
something tangible in the responseBody argument. Encouraged by this I
could now make sense of more of the original Mozilla Developer Network
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;,
in particular their Checking For Success example…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch('flowers.jpg').then(function(response) {
  if(response.ok) {
    response.blob().then(function(myBlob) {
      var objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(myBlob);
      myImage.src = objectURL;
    });
  } else {
    console.log('Network response was not ok.');
  }
})
.catch(function(error) {
  console.log('There has been a problem with your fetch operation: ' +
error.message);
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t give a monkey’s for checking for success in my embryonic
attempt at calling fetch() earlier. But now I could see that I could do
the chaining all in one…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch('my-json-serving-url')
.then(response =&amp;gt; {
  response.json().then(responseBody =&amp;gt; {
    debugger
    console.log(responseBody)
    // Go'on the responseBody, ya beauty!
  })
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ES5 equivalent is something like…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch('my-json-serving-url')
.then(function(response){
  response.json().then(function(responseBody){
    console.log(responseBody)
  })
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it perceptual narrowing when my initial attempt went pear-shaped,
or call it laziness, or stupidity. Whatever it was, that was one long journey towards
calling fetch(). Anyway, I hope someone else finds this useful and
doesn’t have to travel around the Internet a dozen times to ditch the
dollar and fire off a fetch().&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I've Got 409 Problems but the Status Header Ain't One</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A correction…  During last night’s talk on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/theirishpenguin/js_application_reloader&quot;&gt;JS Application Reloader gem&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that when the gem’s back end code detects a reload of the application is required it sends a HTTP 409 to the client. But to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwdba9C2G14&quot;&gt;Chewbacca defence&lt;/a&gt;, “That does not make sense!” A 409 indicates a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/409image.png&quot; alt=&quot;409 Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, the gem never sent back a 409 and never will. Instead, it returns a HTTP header to indicate an expired status (by default this header is called “X-Js-Application-Reloader-Status”). It is this that indicates to the client that the application needs to be reloaded. Incidentally, the gem does allow you to configure a HTTP status code to send back in this situation if you want to (currently the default is 200, which should probably be changed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where did the pesky 409 come from? Well, it became ingrained in my brain as I’m working on another project to handle optimistic locking - which does indeed send back a 409 when a conflict in records is detected. Nothing to do with JS Application Reloader at all :-) It’s like comparing Apples and Androids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I’m making 409 my new lucky number!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great meetup last night. Thanks to everyone for making it such fun!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Purity of the Potato</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pity the potato. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.potato.ie/national-potato-day/&quot;&gt;National Potato Day&lt;/a&gt;, yet our once budding superstar’s been trending downwards ever since huntergathers began dragging their knuckles to the dining table. A carb allergy has infected the nation leaving the humble potato about as popular as a water tax at a car wash. How did the potato turn from staple diet of the people to an episode of Man v Spud? It just wanted to be your spuddy buddy. Leave aside the fact that this vegetable can conjure up more pun potential than Buzzfeed can whip up kitten stories…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure style=&quot;float: right; margin:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/512px-Potato_123.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Potato&quot; width=&quot;360px&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption style=&quot;font-style: italic; margin-top: 5px; width:360px&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Potato_123.jpg&quot;&gt;Photo&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Tahir_mq&quot;&gt;Tahir mq&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Creative_Commons&quot;&gt;CC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en&quot;&gt;Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported&lt;/a&gt; licence&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what happened, we need to understand how this noble vegetable starved then conquered a nation. According to popular legend, it all started with another noble - Sir Walter Raleigh. Back then, a good chipper was just a twinkle in Leo Burdock’s eye. In a field in East Cork, Sir Walter declared “What’s up Youghal? Here’s some potatoes!” And the rest is (slightly made up) history. Once we’d a taste for it, our beloved tuber easily out-muscled other foods. Apparently the choice at the time was somewhat limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other accounts say that the first spud washed up on the shores of Cork, like some glorious cuisine in a bottle from God, just after the Spanish Armada came a cropper. It has also been written that the potato’s introduction into England did not go well, taking flak in newspaper editorials and preachers’ sermons at the time. The man on the street wouldn’t touch it with yours, and rumour had it that potatoes would leave the soil as sterile as a mule convention. Oh, and they made you sick and could cause death. Even Mr Tayto couldn’t talk you into taking a trip to Tayto Park in those days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was then and this is now. Chippies have been ever popular in the best little country in the world. We love our spuds! But the downward spiral here began once Irish restaurants and avid cooks convinced diners to accept things like polenta and couscous. Polenta, a miserable lump which has the texture of damp sawdust, and tastes slightly worse, makes the starting lineup on many a menu. Couscous’ only useful contribution to society is perhaps in the debate over how exactly to pronounce it. Do you go with the lawdy daw Dublin 4 “Koous koous” or the more friendly cat-herding “Kus kus”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here kus kus…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jamie Oliver’s Italian, which does a fine burger, you have to plead your case to ensure your chippies are not doused in garlic, parsley and truffle oil. Whatever happened to the purity of the potato? No nonsense, just a bit of complex carbohydrate and a sprinkle of salt. Hipster eateries offer no respite. In Crackbird you won’t even find a chip on the menu - where’s the craic in that? And don’t start on about sweet potatoes. They’re the kind of thing you should only hear from Robin, pre-Dark Knight, excitedly muttering “Sweet potatoes, Batman!” as the Penguin makes off with the bag of chips that fell from his utility belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official health guidelines are just as scathing. The “5 A Day” police won’t even count a Maris Piper towards your total, just a big fat potato-shaped zero. But it would be unwise to back against the tenacious potato making a comeback. The current crop of diets will ultimately fall out of flavour. Yes, technically on its own the potato will send your blood sugar levels into orbit with Richard Branson and his partying, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thejournal.ie/richard-branson-holiday-time-1688143-Sep2014/&quot;&gt;unlimited-holiday time employees&lt;/a&gt;. But what your gym instructor didn’t tell you is that if you eat your Roosters with a side of meat, its GI drops quicker than Arjen Robben on an ice rink. So no your blood won’t turn to custard. Just sit back, relax, peel a spud and simply enjoy. Of course that doesn’t help us resist all those glorious damn potato flavoured puns that we could drop in here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Must… not… mention… going viral on youtuber…  It’s… Golden… Wonder… we… got.. this… far… Dammit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy National Potato Day, Youghal!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Batshift Crazy - Basic Binary Number Representation in Javascript</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/dublin-code-kata/&quot;&gt;Dublin Code Kata&lt;/a&gt;, we revisited a bit of classic Comp Sci - integer vs binary representation of numbers! And I learned that converting integers to binary numbers isn’t all that hard in Javascript :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;By Cncplayer (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ABinary_Code.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;512&quot; alt=&quot;Binary Code&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Binary_Code.jpg/512px-Binary_Code.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, to convert the integer 4 to the binary number 100 you use…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(4 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0).toString(2) # gives &quot;100&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you want to do chopping of right most digits change the 0 to the number of digits you want to chop off…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(4 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1).toString(2) // gives &quot;10&quot;
(4 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2).toString(2) // gives &quot;1&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you want to append zeros, use the opposite…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(4 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0).toString(2) // still gives &quot;100&quot;
(4 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1).toString(2) // still gives &quot;1000&quot;
(4 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2).toString(2) // still gives &quot;10000&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are called right shift (») and left shift operators («) and there is a variation on the right shift called a zero-fill right shift (»&amp;gt;), as opposed to a sign-propagating right shift (good old »). The difference becomes interesting when you deal with numbers that don’t fit into a 32 bit integer (the upper bound being the magical &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2147483647&quot;&gt;2147483647&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we take a cool two and a half billion we see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(2500000000 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0).toString(2) // gives &quot;-1101010111111010000011100000000&quot;
(2500000000 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0).toString(2) // gives &quot;10010101000000101111100100000000&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that all stemmed from today’s enjoyable challenge &lt;a href=&quot;http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_fifte.html&quot;&gt;A Diversion&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pragdave&quot;&gt;Prag Dave&lt;/a&gt; for sharing! And thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_minuteman3&quot;&gt;Miles McGuire&lt;/a&gt; for bringing the bitshift brains and explaining the more esoteric cases!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some more on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation&quot;&gt;bitwise operators&lt;/a&gt; and more on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators&quot;&gt;bitwise operators in Javascript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rails Girls Revolution</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your first day programming is always going to be a challenging one. It’s hard enough to learn a new language to speak to another human, never mind trying to unravel the mother tongue of a machine. Probably the best way to tackle this challenge is with a sense of mischief, fun and divilment, and a raft of like-minded people. These ingredients made for the perfect recipe that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://railsgirls.com/dublin&quot;&gt;Rails Girls Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, an informal mini-conference like event, that took place at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndrc.ie/&quot;&gt;NDRC&lt;/a&gt; in Digital Hub on Friday and Saturday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BCqzUecCEAMj4OO.jpg:large&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usually male-dominated field of software development was turned on it’s head for a weekend as an attendee list of 50 girls and women set out to learn web programming and art of glueing the cloud together. This was done through &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; - a programming language and toolbox for building web applications in a clear and easy to understand way. This also makes it suitable for newcomers to programming to start off coding and having fun straight away. Ruby is the programming language and Rails is a set of extras that make it particularly useful for the web. Rails Girls is a global organisation that helps make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend started off after work on Friday with an installation fest with the simple goal of getting Ruby on Rails onto everyone’s computer - regardless of whether it tasted like an Apple or was some flavour of Windows or Linux. This was a good chance for everyone to get to know each other, break the ice and get a sense of the fantastic atmosphere that was going to engulf the weekend. Afterwards there was a sponsored meal for the coaches, where one impressive fact became apparent - there was a 50/50 male/female ratio within the coaching group. Something that wasn’t expected when Rails Girls Dublin was starting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BCqKNj0CcAAN7Z7.jpg:large&quot; alt=&quot;Diamonds are a girls best friend but gems are even better&quot; style=&quot;width:50%;margin-left:10px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday began at a relaxing pace with some breakfast and two batches of awesome cupcakes, one by &lt;a href=&quot;http://monacocupcakes.ie&quot;&gt;Monaco Cupcakes&lt;/a&gt; and another by Rails Girl &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/caitrionadwyer&quot;&gt;Caitriona Dwyer&lt;/a&gt;. Then, after a word from the generous sponsors (checkout the list at the end of this post), there was an introductory session on design by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simonrand&quot;&gt;Simon Rand&lt;/a&gt; who had a few tips in there that even old hands could take onboard. Then, despite the best efforts of the Internet trying to work against me, I did a quick session introducing Ruby and the basics of programming. It was really fun going through Ruby with such an interested and engaged audience; and incredible to think that everyone there could call themselves a programmer - in one way or another - by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final bit of preparation was a “Bento Box” session with &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/emcastles&quot;&gt;Emily Castles&lt;/a&gt;, the unstoppable driving force behind Rails Girls Dublin. This got everyone to categorize some of the techie jargon that crops up in web development into different compartments - hence just like a Bento Box! If you missed out on those talks the good news is that you can catch up on Simon’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/simonrand/designing-your-app&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; online and go through the basics of Ruby at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tryruby.org&quot;&gt;tryruby.org&lt;/a&gt; in your own time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the main event started, where attendees flipped open their laptops and started hacking on their own Rails application, following a set of guides put together by the fantastic international Rails Girls organisation. Over the course of the day, their applications evolved from a skeleton Rails program, through to one that could handle the uploading and publishing of pictures, before finally being deployed live to a website running online. Here’s a selection of tweets that sum up some of the experiences on this journey,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1307.beta.photobucket.com/user/theirishpenguin/media/self_learn_zps6f731a02.png.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width:inherit&quot; src=&quot;http://i1307.photobucket.com/albums/s584/theirishpenguin/self_learn_zps6f731a02.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot; photo self_learn_zps6f731a02.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1307.beta.photobucket.com/user/theirishpenguin/media/rails_easy_install_zps86d8f2c7.png.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width:inherit&quot; src=&quot;http://i1307.photobucket.com/albums/s584/theirishpenguin/rails_easy_install_zps86d8f2c7.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot; photo rails_easy_install_zps86d8f2c7.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1307.beta.photobucket.com/user/theirishpenguin/media/awesome_job_zps916b0fe1.png.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width:inherit&quot; src=&quot;http://i1307.photobucket.com/albums/s584/theirishpenguin/awesome_job_zps916b0fe1.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot; photo awesome_job_zps916b0fe1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1307.beta.photobucket.com/user/theirishpenguin/media/sarah_great_day_zps820b8e72.png.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width:inherit&quot; src=&quot;http://i1307.photobucket.com/albums/s584/theirishpenguin/sarah_great_day_zps820b8e72.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot; photo sarah_great_day_zps820b8e72.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there was a set of great lightning talks before &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kategoodbody&quot;&gt;Kate Goodbody&lt;/a&gt; brought the curtain down on Rails Girls Dublin - live coding a Ruby on Rails blog in under 10 minutes as stirring music boomed over the speakers. There wasn’t as much as a single misguided keystroke and it was a wonderful end to a tremendous day of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generous sponsorship meant that was no fighting over the bill at Arthur’s pub around the corner, where most of us had the chance to go afterwards. Like at many events, the evening was a real highlight as everyone shared their ideas for projects (some of which are already underway) and ways to keep the fire lit this weekend burning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future will be written in code. Google will possibly be one of the biggest car companies in 10 years time; they have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdgQpa1pUUE&quot;&gt;self driving car&lt;/a&gt;. Wearable technology will be woven into the clothing we buy. Every inanimate object we currently see around us will, over time, be transformed into something that reacts to us with software smarts. Whether all this is a good thing or a bad thing is up for debate. What is certain is that it’s crucial that girls and women are represented in the next wave of technology in a way they previously weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next challenge for Rails Girls Dublin will be around how to build on the great start that was made this weekend. With so many attendees, coaches and organisers interested and passionate about making this work, it’s a vision that has every chance of succeeding and surpassing its original goals!&lt;/p&gt;
